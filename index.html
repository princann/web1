a. Market economy: A market economy is one in which resources are primarily owned and controlled by the private sector, not the public sector. The key factors that make the market economy work are consumer sovereignty and freedom of companies to operate in the market. Prices are determined by supply and demand.
<p>b. Command economy: In a command economy, also known as a centrally planned economy, all dimensions of economic activity, including pricing and production decisions, are determined by a central government plan. The government owns and controls all resources. The government sets goals for every business enterprise in the country by how much they produce and for whom. In this type of economy, the government considers itself a better judge of resource allocation than its businesses or citizens.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">c. Mixed economy: In actuality, no economy is purely market or completely command oriented. Most economies are mixed economies, falling in the middle and combining elements of both. In a mixed economy, economic decisions are principally market driven and ownership is principally private, but the government intervenes, from slightly to extensively, in resource allocations and economic decisions.
